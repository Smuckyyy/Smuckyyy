- ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Smucky, a student currently studying Computer Science
- Iâ€™m interested in everything tech, trying to learn as much as I possibly can
- I'm currently trying to learn how to use a Flipper Zero, a first for me. 
- If anyone on GitHub would like to help a fellow newbie when it comes to coding and all things, please reach out, it's much appreciated!
